I have successfully completed the Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp, demonstrating my ability to build accessible, user-friendly, and fully responsive websites. As part of this certification, I developed and passed all automated test suites for five structured projects:

    Survey Form – Designed an interactive form with responsive input fields and validation.
    Tribute Page – Created a visually appealing and well-structured tribute page.
    Technical Documentation Page – Developed an informative and organized documentation webpage.
    Product Landing Page – Built a professional landing page with engaging design elements.
    Personal Portfolio Webpage – Showcased my portfolio featuring past projects and achievements.
